# Forecasting-Demand-Project
Demand forecasting plays a crucial role in optimizing resource allocation, managing inventory, and ensuring operational efficiency for defense companies. Accurate forecasting allows these organizations to anticipate future demand for their products and services, thereby enhancing their strategic planning and decision-making processes.the project explores the application of machine learning techniques to forecast demand for defense companies. Although we were unable to access proprietary data from companies like BEML due to confidentiality constraints,i utilized simulated or dummy data to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

The primary objective of this project is to develop and evaluate machine learning models capable of accurately predicting demand based on historical sales data, market trends, and other relevant factors. By leveraging Python programming language and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, I have implemented various forecasting models and evaluated their performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.
Key Highlights:

Utilization of machine learning algorithms for demand forecasting.
Analysis and interpretation of dummy data to simulate real-world scenarios.
Evaluation of model performance using standard evaluation metrics.
Insights into the implications and significance of accurate demand forecasting for defense companies.
