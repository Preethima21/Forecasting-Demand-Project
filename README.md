# Forecasting-Demand-Project
Demand forecasting plays a crucial role in optimizing resource allocation, managing inventory, and ensuring operational efficiency for defense companies. Accurate forecasting allows these organizations to anticipate future demand for their products and services, thereby enhancing their strategic planning and decision-making processes.the project explores the application of machine learning techniques to forecast demand for defense companies. Although we were unable to access proprietary data from companies like BEML due to confidentiality constraints,i utilized simulated or dummy data to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

The primary objective of this project is to develop and evaluate machine learning models capable of accurately predicting demand based on historical sales data, market trends, and other relevant factors. By leveraging Python programming language and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, I have implemented various forecasting models and evaluated their performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.
Key Highlights:

Utilization of machine learning algorithms for demand forecasting.
Analysis and interpretation of dummy data to simulate real-world scenarios.
Evaluation of model performance using standard evaluation metrics.
Insights into the implications and significance of accurate demand forecasting for defense companies.

Methodology:

Data Collection: Gather historical data related to ERP implementations, including costs incurred for software licenses, hardware infrastructure, customization, training, maintenance, and support.

Preprocessing: Cleanse and preprocess the collected data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring data quality and reliability.

Feature Selection:Identify relevant features contributing to cost prediction, considering factors such as industry benchmarks, historical trends, and organizational specifics.

Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for cost prediction, considering factors like regression techniques, ensemble methods, and neural networks.

Training: Train the selected machine learning models using the preprocessed data, optimizing hyperparameters and performance metrics to enhance prediction accuracy.

Evaluation: Evaluate the trained models using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and accuracy, to assess their effectiveness in predicting costs accurately.

Deployment:Deploy the trained model into a production environment, integrating it into the ERP implementation process to provide real-time cost predictions and support resource allocation decisions effectively.

Data Visualization :Develop interactive dashboards and reports to enable users to explore data and make informed decisions.Incorporate visual representations such as charts, graphs, and heatmaps to facilitate data interpretation.
